### Header 3
#### Header 4

This is plain text, with **bold** and _italic_ as well

An external link looks like [Google](https://google.com)

A string with <span class="small-caps">SMALL CAPS</span> looks like this.

- bullet
- list
- cool

1. Something
2. Another thing

Literally you don't need `inline code blocks` or

<small>Small text is one step down from the base.</small>

``` js

var foo = 5 * 3;
console.log(foo);
```
yet. Write the styling when you do.
